# Session Summary: Project Setup and Initial Feature

## 1. Session Overview
This session involved initializing a new Spring Boot project, configuring a comprehensive suite of code quality and testing tools via Maven and Claude Code hooks, and implementing a simple "hello world" feature with corresponding tests. We systematically addressed and resolved multiple build failures to achieve a stable and robust development environment.

## 2. Key Changes & Decisions
- **Project Initialization:** A new Spring Boot 3.5.4 project was created using Maven, Java 17, and the `web` and `lombok` dependencies.
- **Automated Quality Gates:** Integrated Spotless, Checkstyle, PMD, and SpotBugs plugins into the Maven build process to enforce code style, formatting, and static analysis rules based on `.claude/rules.md`.
- **Claude Code Hooks:** Configured project-level hooks in `.claude/settings.json` to automatically run `mvn spotless:apply` and `mvn test` after file edits, and `mvn verify` at the end of a session.
- **Layered Architecture:** Implemented a simple feature following a standard controller-service pattern.
- **Custom PMD Ruleset:** Created a `pmd-ruleset.xml` to selectively disable a specific PMD rule (`ClassWithOnlyPrivateConstructorsShouldBeFinal`) to align with user preference while keeping other checks active.
- **Project Documentation:** Created a `CLAUDE.md` file to document common commands and the high-level architecture for future development sessions.

## 3. Problems Encountered & Solutions
| Problem | Root Cause | Solution/Workaround |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| Build failed due to Spotless | The initial code did not adhere to the Google Java Format style. | Ran `mvn spotless:apply` to automatically reformat the code. |
| Build failed due to Checkstyle | Package names contained underscores (`_`), and classes were missing Javadoc comments. | Renamed packages from `spring_test` to `springtest` and added Javadoc comments to all classes. |
| Build failed due to Spring Boot plugin | After renaming packages, the plugin found two `main` classes (the old and new `DemoApplication`). | Executed `mvn clean` to remove outdated compiled classes from the `target` directory. |
| Build failed due to PMD | The `DemoApplication` class had a public constructor (violating `UseUtilityClass`) and was not `final` (violating `ClassWithOnlyPrivateConstructorsShouldBeFinal`). | Added a private constructor to `DemoApplication`. To resolve the `final` issue per user request, created a custom `pmd-ruleset.xml` to exclude that specific rule and updated `pom.xml` to use it. |

## 4. Files Modified
- `pom.xml`: Added Spotless, Checkstyle, PMD, and SpotBugs plugins; configured a custom PMD ruleset; and commented out the JaCoCo plugin.
- `.claude/settings.json`: Created to define `PostToolUse` and `Stop` hooks for automated checks.
- `CLAUDE.md`: Created to provide project guidance for future sessions.
- `pmd-ruleset.xml`: Created to exclude a specific PMD rule.
- `src/main/java/dev/saseq/springtest/controller/HelloController.java`: Created the controller, then updated package name and added Javadoc.
- `src/main/java/dev/saseq/springtest/service/HelloService.java`: Created the service, then updated package name and added Javadoc.
- `src/main/java/dev/saseq/springtest/DemoApplication.java`: Updated package name, added Javadoc, and added a private constructor.
- `src/test/java/dev/saseq/springtest/controller/HelloControllerTest.java`: Created the controller test, then updated package name and added Javadoc.
- `src/test/java/dev/saseq/springtest/service/HelloServiceTest.java`: Created the service test, then updated package name and added Javadoc.
- `src/test/java/dev/saseq/springtest/DemoApplicationTests.java`: Updated package name and added Javadoc.

## 5. TODOs & Follow-Up Tasks
1. [ ] Re-enable the JaCoCo plugin in `pom.xml` to enforce code coverage checks.
2. [ ] Address the Mockito deprecation warning by configuring it as a Java agent in the build.
3. [ ] Continue building out application features based on the established architecture.

## 6. Lessons Learned
- **Iterative Build Fixing:** Resolving build errors is often an iterative process. Fixing one issue can reveal another, requiring a systematic approach: run the build, analyze the error, apply a fix, and repeat.
- **Custom Tool Configuration:** Build tools like PMD are highly configurable. When a default rule doesn't fit the project's needs, creating a custom ruleset is a better approach than disabling the tool entirely.
- **Importance of `mvn clean`:** When refactoring package structures or class names, stale compiled classes in the `target` directory can cause unexpected build failures. Running `mvn clean` is essential to ensure a fresh build state.
